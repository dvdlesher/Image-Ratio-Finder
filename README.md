# Image-Ratio-Finder
This is an application for finding images that has specific size, or specific ratio in a folder with images.

### Quick backstory of this app motivation:
> Initially, the application were made for finding wallpaper with specific ratio in a big batch of images in a folder.
> Specifically, this app is for sifting images downloaded from imageboard website. (Such as 4chan, imgur or booru websites)

### How it works:
The application will take ratio and/or size input, search all images in a folder, and then lets user see the images that fits the category, or copy/move the matched images to a different location
Subfolder name will be based on the test chosen to find the images. For example:
- Ratio-only test of 16:9 will result in subfolder named "16:9"
- Size-only test of 1920x1080 will result in subfolder named "1920x1080"
- Both tests chosen of 16:9 and 1920x1080 will result in subfolder named "16:9, 1920x1080"

Additionally, the application has "tolerance" setting to ensure images with very similar size/ratio can be included. Set it to 0.1% or lower if you wish for only exact matches.
However, the matched images will not be cropped nor resized to fit target ratio/size.

As for now, user can filter images based on
- Image size
- Ratio
- Both
